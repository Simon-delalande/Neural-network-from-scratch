# Neural-network-from-scratch

In this project, I implemented a neural network from scratch for an educational purpose.

I started with the file binary_classifer to implement a binary classifier with 2 layers and an arbitrary number of neurons. It enabled me to start with a simpler subcase and to concentrate on only a part of the difficulties. 
Once it was done, I implemented a general dense neural network constructor in the file general_neural_net. A vast part of the work was already done in the previous case, the diffuclty here was to adapt the code for the general case where the number of layers is not fixed.
